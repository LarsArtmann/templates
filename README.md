# LarsArtmann/templates

This repository serves as a centralized collection of templates, best practices, and automation tools for software development projects.

## Purpose

This repository is part of the larger initiative described in [LarsArtmann/mono#42](https://github.com/LarsArtmann/mono/issues/42) to create a single source of truth for development standards and practices accumulated over 12+ years of software architecture experience.

The templates repository will include:
- Project templates for various languages and architectures
- GitHub automation tools and workflows
- Infrastructure as Code templates
- Code quality and security configurations
- Documentation templates and standards

## Current Status

This repository is in its initial setup phase. The structure and content will be expanded incrementally through future issues.

## Directory Structure

```
templates/
├── README.md (this file)
├── .gitignore
└── github/
    └── README.md (GitHub-specific templates and automation)
```

- Implementing specific components described in issue #42
- Starting with the GitHub label standardization (issue #38)
